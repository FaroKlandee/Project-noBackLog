PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY - NoBacklog MVP
Project: AI-powered Trello-like task management app with natural language command interface
Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB (local + Atlas cloud dual setup)
AI: Anthropic Claude API (not yet implemented)
Frontend: React (not yet started)

Completed:

Development environment setup (MongoDB local + Atlas)
Project structure (src/models, src/routes, src/controllers, src/services, src/config)
Database configuration (src/config/database.js) with dual environment support
Four complete Mongoose models with relationships:

Board.js - Board model
List.js - List model (references Board)
Card.js - Card model (references List)
TimeLog.js - TimeLog model (references Card)


Models index file (src/models/index.js) for clean imports
Basic server setup (src/server.js) with Express, CORS, JSON parsing
Test route verified - models working, data creates successfully in MongoDB

Current Phase: Building API Routes & Controllers (Part 9)
Decision Made: Using router.route() pattern for cleaner, more maintainable route definitions
Next Steps:

Complete src/controllers/boardController.js with all 5 CRUD functions
Create src/routes/boardRoutes.js using router.route() pattern
Mount routes in server.js
Test endpoints with Postman/Thunder Client

Architecture Pattern: Backend processing (Option A) - AI calls happen on backend for security

Completed:

Development environment setup (MongoDB local + Atlas)
Project structure (src/models, src/routes, src/controllers, src/services, src/config)
Database configuration (src/config/database.js) with dual environment support
Four complete Mongoose models with relationships:

Board.js - Board model (field: name)
List.js - List model (references Board)
Card.js - Card model (references List)
TimeLog.js - TimeLog model (references Card)


Models index file (src/models/index.js) for clean imports
Complete server setup (src/server.js) with Express, CORS, JSON parsing
FULLY COMPLETE Board API with all 5 CRUD operations:

src/controllers/boardController.js - All functions implemented
src/routes/boardRoutes.js - Using router.route() pattern, mounted at /api/boards
All endpoints tested with Thunder Client - ALL PASSING ✅
Validation working (empty names rejected)
Error handling working (404s, 500s)
Database persistence verified in MongoDB Compass

Complete Board API (5/5 CRUD operations) - fully tested
Complete List API (5/5 CRUD operations) - fully tested
